<h1>Logistic Modeling with Interactions</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project builds on the previous project :

[Logistic Modeling and Plotting Curves](https://github.com/MeghanKPartrick/Logistic-Modeling-and-Plotting)

<br />
This project builds upon the fundamental principles of logistic modeling, introducing interaction terms to enrich the predictive capacity of the model. The project incorporates chi-squared tests for significance testing, generates insightful visual representations, and implements model selection methods.
